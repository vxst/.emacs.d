1.1 `php-extras-insert-previous-variable'
=========================================

When variable names get to long or you have to juggle a lot of nested
arrays it gets cumbersome to repeat the same variables over and over
again while programming.

   In example you have the code below and want to debug what value you
actually parsed to `some_function()'. You have point at `^' and now all
you have to write is repeat the variable...

some_function($my_array['some_level'][0]['another_level][7]);
print_r(^);

   Enter `php-extras' and you just hit C-c C-$ and it will insert the
previous variable (including array indexes).

   If you prefix the command (i.e. C-u 3 C-c C-$) it will search back 3
variables and with negative prefix arguments it will search forward.

1.2 `php-extras-eldoc-documentation-function'
=============================================

`eldoc-mode' is a nice minor mode that ships with Emacs. It will
display a function tip in mini buffer showing the function and its
arguments for the function at point. That is if you provide a function
to look up the function definition.

   `php-extras' provides such a function for looking up all the core
PHP functions.

   The function `php-extras-generate-eldoc' will download the PHP
manual from php.net (http://php.net) and extract the function
definitions (slow) and store them in a hash table on disk for you. If
you install `php-extras' as an ELPA package the hash table is already
generated for you.

1.3 Installation
================

The easiest way to install `php-extras' is probably to install it via
the ELPA archive at Marmalade
(http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/php-extras).

   ELPA (package.el) is part of Emacs 24. For Emacs 23 see Marmalade
(http://marmalade-repo.org) for installation instructions.
